## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Tap-to-switch latency: median <= 50ms, p95 <= 100ms on mid-tier mobile; measure 200 taps in a controlled test. Context: supports blitz/rapid play without hesitation.
- Start-to-running after tapping Start: <= 1s; measure time from Start tap to active timer countdown. Context: keeps setup under 60 seconds.

### Reliability
- Timer drift: <= 100ms over 10 minutes; measure against a reference clock during a 10-minute run. Context: fairness in timed play.
- Missed tap rate: <= 1% over 200 taps; measure missed taps during controlled play. Context: prevents disputed moves.
- Offline flows: 100% pass in smoke tests after first load across supported browsers. Context: ensures reliability when network drops.
- State preservation: game resumes correctly after 30 minutes of backgrounding/refresh; verify timers and active side unchanged. Context: prevents game loss.
- Keep-awake effectiveness: when enabled, the screen does not dim/lock for at least 20 minutes on supported browsers; verify with a controlled 20-minute session. Context: uninterrupted play.
- Client errors are captured and reported for reliability monitoring; error reporting does not block gameplay. Context: rapid detection and fix of issues.

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for contrast and interaction; verify with automated audit + manual review. Context: baseline accessibility for public users.
- Contrast >= 4.5:1 for timer text and active states; verify with contrast checker. Context: readability in bright environments.
- Touch targets >= 44px and visible focus on all controls; verify at 360px viewport. Context: prevents mis-taps and supports keyboard users.
- Reduced-motion preference disables non-essential animations; verify with OS setting. Context: motion sensitivity.

### Security & Privacy
- No accounts or PII collection; verify no PII fields and no PII in analytics events. Context: privacy-first MVP.
- Settings and game state stored locally only; verify no network persistence during settings changes. Context: minimize data exposure.

## Architecture and Data Flow (Lightweight)

### Key Components
- UI Layer: Preset/start screen, in-game timer view, settings drawer.
- Timer Engine: State machine for running/paused/ended, turn switching, undo stack.
- Persistence Layer: Local storage for last-used control, settings, and in-progress game state.
- Offline Layer: Service Worker + cache for app shell and core assets.

### Offline Cache
- Cache the app shell on first load (HTML/CSS/JS/fonts/icons) so repeat visits load offline.
- Use a network-first strategy for the landing HTML and a cache-first strategy for static assets.
- Ensure all gameplay flows (start, switch, pause, reset, undo, settings) work without network.

### Local Persistence
- Store settings (sound, vibration, contrast, keep-screen-awake) and last-used control locally.
- Persist active game state (timers, active side, turn index, pause state) on visibility change and before unload.
- On launch, restore last game state if it is less than 30 minutes old; otherwise start fresh with last-used control.

### Timer Update Loop
- Use a high-resolution monotonic clock (e.g., performance.now) to compute elapsed time deltas.
- Run the update loop with requestAnimationFrame while the game is active and visible.
- On visibility change or backgrounding, pause the loop and persist state to avoid drift.
- Apply increment/delay on move switch, not on every tick, to keep timing stable.

## UX Requirements

### Information Architecture
- Landing: Preset list + Start action + Custom control entry.
- In-game: Two large tap zones, timers, and compact controls (pause, reset, undo).
- Settings: Bottom sheet/drawer accessible during active play; sound, vibration, keep-screen-awake, contrast.

### Interaction Details
- Single tap switches turns with immediate visual and haptic feedback.
- Pause locks both timers and disables tap zones.
- Undo restores last active player and time value.

### Edge Cases
- Backgrounding or screen lock during an active game pauses timers and preserves state; on return, the user can resume with a single tap.
- Orientation change during an active game preserves timers, active side, and control visibility without resetting.
- If Wake Lock is unavailable, show a non-blocking banner warning during active play.
- Invalid custom control inputs (negative values, zero base time) show inline validation and prevent start.
- Unsupported browsers show a friendly warning and continue with degraded features.

### UX Validation Checklist
- Background/resume: timers pause on backgrounding and resume without drift; state preserved after 30 minutes.
- Screen lock: wake lock prevents dimming where supported; fallback banner visible and non-blocking where unsupported.
- Orientation: no layout clipping; tap zones remain >=40% viewport height.
- Input validation: invalid custom control inputs show errors and block Start.
- Accessibility: focus visible for all controls; reduced motion disables non-essential animations.

### Visual and Brand
- Minimal, Teenage Engineering-inspired aesthetic.
- Large typography and strong hierarchy.
- Neutral palette with a single accent color for active side.
- Clean Band direction with a rotated timer display for one player (180 degrees) while controls remain upright.
- Design system: shadcn/ui base components with custom theme.

### Component States
- Timer Display: idle (no game), running (active side highlighted), paused (both dimmed), completed (zero time reached with end state).
- Tap Zones: idle (enabled), running (active side enabled), paused (disabled), error (disabled with inline message).
- Controls (pause/reset/undo): idle (available), running (available), paused (resume available), error (disabled if no game state).
- Preset List: idle (browsing), selected (highlighted), locked (hidden during active game), error (invalid preset input).
- Settings: idle (browsing), active (toggle on), disabled (if unsupported), error (validation message).

## End-to-End Test Plan

### Core Scenarios
1. **First-time preset start (online):** From landing page, select a preset and tap Start. **Pass** if game starts within 1s and active side highlights; **Fail** if start exceeds 1s or timers do not begin.
2. **Custom control validation + start:** Enter invalid values (negative/zero base), then valid values, save, and start. **Pass** if invalid input blocks Start with inline error and valid input saves within 1s and starts within 1s; **Fail** if invalid input starts or valid input does not save/start.
3. **Turn switching + undo:** During active game, switch turns 10 times, then undo once. **Pass** if each switch updates active side within 50ms and undo restores prior side/time; **Fail** if any switch exceeds 50ms or undo state is incorrect.
4. **Pause/resume integrity:** Start a game, pause for 10 seconds, resume. **Pass** if timers do not change while paused and resume continues from exact prior values; **Fail** if time changes while paused or resumes incorrectly.
5. **Reset flow:** Start a game, play 30 seconds, reset. **Pass** if both timers return to initial control and active side resets; **Fail** if any time or active side persists.
6. **Offline reliability (post-first-load):** Load once online, go offline, relaunch, and start a preset game with switches/pause/undo. **Pass** if app loads and all core controls work offline; **Fail** if app fails to load or any core control is broken.
7. **Orientation change during play:** Start a game, rotate between portrait and landscape. **Pass** if game state persists and tap zones/controls remain visible without scrolling; **Fail** if state resets or controls/tap zones clip.
8. **Install + launch from home screen:** Trigger install, open from home screen, start a game. **Pass** if app opens within 2s and start works; **Fail** if launch exceeds 2s or start fails.

## Browser Matrix

- Mobile: iOS Safari and Android Chrome (latest 2 major versions).
- Desktop: Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox (latest 2 major versions).
- Unsupported: legacy browsers that lack Service Worker or Wake Lock support should show a friendly warning and continue with degraded features.

## Responsive Design

- Mobile-first, single-column layout that keeps the timer as the primary focus.
- Support portrait and landscape with tap zones and timers always visible.
- Use safe-area insets for notches and system UI overlays.
- Ensure controls remain reachable on 360px-wide devices and scale for tablets/desktops without adding clutter.

## Performance Targets

- LCP <= 2.5s on mid-tier mobile over 4G; measure with Lighthouse mobile profile and 4G throttling. Context: ensures fast first use.
- INP <= 200ms for core timer interactions; measure via web-vitals sampling of in-game taps. Context: keeps play responsive.
- CLS <= 0.1 on first load; measure via Lighthouse or web-vitals on initial load. Context: prevents layout shifts during setup.
- Repeat visit load <= 2s (cached); measure on second visit with warmed cache on mid-tier mobile. Context: supports quick restarts.

## SEO Strategy

- App is not indexed; add `noindex` and restrict indexing via robots.txt.
- Marketing site will be built later and handled separately.

## Accessibility Level

- Target WCAG 2.1 AA for contrast and interaction; verify with automated audit and manual review. Context: baseline accessibility compliance.
- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text and active timer states; verify with contrast checker. Context: readability in bright environments.
- Touch targets >= 44px for all tappable controls; verify CSS pixel sizes at 360px-wide viewport. Context: reduce mis-taps.
- Visible focus styles and support for reduced motion; verify keyboard focus on all controls and reduced-motion setting disables non-essential motion. Context: accessibility for keyboard and motion-sensitive users.

### Instrumentation Completeness Metrics
- Property coverage target for core events (App open, Game start, Turn switch, Pause/resume, Reset, Undo, PWA install): >=98% of events include all required properties listed above.
- Optional property coverage: >=90% for any optional properties added later; required vs optional defined in schema.
- Release gate: fail analytics QA if any core event drops below 95% required-property coverage in staging samples.

### Metrics
- Time-to-first-game
- Session length
- Repeat sessions per user
- PWA install rate
- Install-to-weekly-active ratio
- Undo usage rate

### Segmentation Notes
- Split key metrics by install_state (installed/web) and platform (iOS/Android/Desktop).
- Track entry_source (direct/share) for time-to-first-game and share/referral impact.
- Compare preset vs custom control usage for session length and repeat sessions.
- Segment offline vs online sessions for reliability and retention impact.

### Retention Analysis Plan
- Cohort construction: weekly cohorts based on first Game start date (UTC week start Monday); include users with at least one Game start in the cohort week.
- Retention definition: returning if App open or Game start occurs on D1, D7, or D30 after cohort start; report D1/D7/D30 percentages.
- Review cadence: D1/D7 reviewed weekly; D30 reviewed monthly with rolling 3-cohort average.

### Analytics QA Plan
- Event schema validation on staging before each release (required properties present, correct types).
- Sample 20 sessions per platform (iOS/Android/Desktop) monthly to verify event counts and timing.
- Alert if event volume drops >20% week-over-week for core events (App open, Game start, Turn switch).
- Quarterly audit of event definitions against product metrics to prevent drift.

### Instrumentation QA Dashboards
- Event delivery latency p95 < 5 minutes for core events (App open, Game start, Turn switch) over last 24h; alert if >10 minutes for 2 consecutive hours.
- App open -> Game start conversion within +-15% of 28-day baseline; alert if drops >20% day-over-day.
- Required property completeness for Game start >= 99% daily; alert if <97%.
- Turn switch events per Game start within 10-200 (daily median); alert if outside range for any platform.

### Analytics Ownership and SLAs
- Owner: Product + Engineering jointly responsible for KPI definitions and dashboards.
- KPI review cadence: weekly for acquisition/activation, monthly for retention.
- Incident SLA: investigate tracking anomalies within 2 business days of alert.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Timer drift on mobile browsers:** use high-resolution timers and background-safe scheduling; test across iOS/Android.
- **Missed taps during fast play:** large tap zones and immediate feedback; use touch event handling with minimal debounce.
- **PWA install friction:** provide clear in-app hints for install; avoid full-screen prompts that interrupt first play.
- **Device sleep during play:** keep-screen-awake setting uses wake lock; provide fallback messaging if unsupported.

## Assumptions

- Users have modern mobile browsers that support PWA features.
- Most play happens on phones, not tablets or desktops.
- Users prefer presets over deep configuration.

## Dependencies

- Browser support for PWA install and offline cache.
- Wake Lock API availability or fallback.

## Open Questions

- None (defaults locked: presets, sound/vibration ON, onboarding cue included).

## Milestones

### MVP Build
- Core timer engine and UI.
- Presets and custom control.
- Pause/reset/undo.
- PWA offline support and installability.

### MVP Validation
- Real-play tests for drift and missed taps.
- First-time user time-to-start measurement.
- Install and offline reliability checks.

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas
- **Adaptive hit-surface turn switching:** active player gets ~80% of the screen as the tap target; the inactive player shows in a compact 20% strip with time.
- **Contextual pause interaction:** tapping the 20% strip pauses and expands the layout to 50/50 for each player to clearly show both timers.

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape
- Most web chess timers use symmetric 50/50 split with tap-to-switch and separate pause/reset controls.
- The adaptive 80/20 hit-surface is a distinct interaction pattern that prioritizes active-player tap accuracy and reduces accidental switches.

### Validation Approach
- **Usability:** >=95% successful turn switches within 1 tap; missed-tap rate <=1% over 200 taps.
- **Efficiency:** time-to-first-game <=60s with the adaptive layout enabled.
- **Preference:** >=70% of users prefer adaptive layout vs 50/50 in a controlled A/B test (n>=30).

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** users may be confused by asymmetric layout.
  **Mitigation:** provide a quick onboarding tip and allow a settings toggle for classic 50/50 layout.
- **Risk:** pause gesture on the 20% strip could be triggered accidentally.
  **Mitigation:** require a deliberate tap with subtle confirmation (haptic + label) and allow disabling pause-tap in settings.
- **Risk:** small inactive timer may reduce readability.
  **Mitigation:** ensure minimum font size and provide a temporary full-screen 50/50 pause view.

## Web App Specific Requirements

### Project-Type Overview
- Single-page application delivered as a PWA for modern mobile browsers.
- App-only scope (no marketing site in this build).
- No real-time sync requirements; single device per playing pair.

### Technical Architecture Considerations
- SPA routing with offline-first shell caching for instant launch.
- Service Worker for installability and offline play.
- No server-side sync; state is local only.
- Accessibility target: WCAG 2.1 AA.

## Project Scoping & Phased Development
