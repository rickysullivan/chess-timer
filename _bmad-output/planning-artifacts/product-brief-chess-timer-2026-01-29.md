## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Chess players need a simple, reliable timer that works on any device without App Store friction or bloated features, so they can start a game quickly and focus on play.

### Problem Impact

Clubs, friends, and schools often resort to bulky physical clocks or outdated apps and sites, which slow setup, feel untrustworthy, or are not optimized for mobile use. This friction reduces adoption and creates unnecessary hassle during games.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Physical clocks are inconvenient to carry and set up, many mobile apps require installs and feel overbuilt, and web timers like chessclock.org look dated and are not optimized or installable on mobile. None combine instant access, modern design, and offline readiness.

### Proposed Solution

A beautiful, instant, installable chess timer that starts in seconds and never gets in the way of the game, mobile-first, offline-ready, and frictionless to share and use anywhere.

### Key Differentiators

- Zero-friction access: no App Store install, instant web launch
- PWA installable for repeat use and offline reliability
- Clean, Teenage Engineering-inspired minimalist UI
- Mobile-first, fast setup, and fast-to-use controls
