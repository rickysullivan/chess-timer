# UX Flow Notes

## Journey Patterns

- Fast start from preset list with no intermediate screens.
- Single-tap turn switch with immediate feedback.
- Recovery actions (pause/undo/reset) always available and non-destructive.
- Offline-first flows mirror online behavior.

## Flow Optimization Principles

- Minimize steps to "game running".
- Keep decision points binary and visible (preset > start).
- Favor persistent controls over hidden menus during play.
- Treat error recovery as a first-class, single-tap action.
