Total FRs: 32

### Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Tap-to-switch latency: median <= 50ms, p95 <= 100ms on mid-tier mobile; measure 200 taps in a controlled test. Context: supports blitz/rapid play without hesitation.
NFR2: Start-to-running after tapping Start: <= 1s; measure time from Start tap to active timer countdown. Context: keeps setup under 60 seconds.
NFR3: Timer drift: <= 100ms over 10 minutes; measure against a reference clock during a 10-minute run. Context: fairness in timed play.
NFR4: Missed tap rate: <= 1% over 200 taps; measure missed taps during controlled play. Context: prevents disputed moves.
NFR5: Offline flows: 100% pass in smoke tests after first load across supported browsers. Context: ensures reliability when network drops.
NFR6: State preservation: game resumes correctly after 30 minutes of backgrounding/refresh; verify timers and active side unchanged. Context: prevents game loss.
NFR7: Keep-awake effectiveness: when enabled, the screen does not dim/lock for at least 20 minutes on supported browsers; verify with a controlled 20-minute session. Context: uninterrupted play.
NFR8: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for contrast and interaction; verify with automated audit + manual review. Context: baseline accessibility for public users.
NFR9: Contrast >= 4.5:1 for timer text and active states; verify with contrast checker. Context: readability in bright environments.
NFR10: Touch targets >= 44px and visible focus on all controls; verify at 360px viewport. Context: prevents mis-taps and supports keyboard users.
NFR11: Reduced-motion preference disables non-essential animations; verify with OS setting. Context: motion sensitivity.
NFR12: No accounts or PII collection; verify no PII fields and no PII in analytics events. Context: privacy-first MVP.
NFR13: Settings and game state stored locally only; verify no network persistence during settings changes. Context: minimize data exposure.

Total NFRs: 13

### Additional Requirements

- Non-goals: accounts, cloud sync, multiplayer, deep stats/ratings/analysis, tournament management, analytics dashboard/reporting UI, themes/dark mode in MVP.
- Assumptions: modern mobile browsers with PWA support; most play on phones; users prefer presets over deep configuration.
- Dependencies: PWA install and offline cache support; Wake Lock API availability or fallback.
- Open questions: MVP preset list; default haptic/sound behavior on first launch; include a first-use “switch sides” prompt.
- Offline cache strategy: network-first for landing HTML, cache-first for static assets; all gameplay flows must work offline.
- Persistence rules: store settings and last-used control locally; persist active game state on visibility change/before unload; restore game state if < 30 minutes old.
- Timer update loop: use high-resolution monotonic clock (e.g., performance.now); update with requestAnimationFrame; pause loop on visibility change; apply increment/delay on move switch.
- UX edge cases: backgrounding/lock pauses timers and preserves state; orientation change preserves timers/controls; wake-lock fallback banner when unavailable; invalid custom control inputs block Start with inline validation.
- SEO constraint: app not indexed; add noindex and restrict indexing via robots.txt.

### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD provides explicit FRs and measurable NFRs with strong traceability links, detailed UX requirements, and a clear MVP scope. Remaining gaps are primarily decision points (preset list, default haptics/sound, first-use prompt) and implementation dependencies (Wake Lock support and offline caching behavior) that need resolution before build. Analytics requirements are defined at the event/property level but lack tooling/vendor selection and data retention policy, which may affect implementation planning.

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

Found: `docs/design/ux-specification.md`

### Alignment Issues

- UX specifies rotated timer digits for opposite-seating readability; this is not explicitly captured in PRD requirements and should be added as a PRD requirement or confirmed as a design decision.
- UX mandates shadcn/ui as a base component system and a specific visual direction (accent `#EC7B43`, Direction B/option-B), which are not explicitly documented in the PRD; confirm whether these are authoritative product requirements or implementation choices.
- UX expects settings access via a non-disruptive drawer/sheet; architecture includes a `/settings` route. Ensure route usage does not break the “no navigation during play” UX requirement (drawer overlay or in-place settings view).

### Warnings

- No missing UX documentation detected; alignment generally strong across PRD and Architecture. The open items above should be confirmed to avoid scope drift.

## Epic Quality Review

### 🔴 Critical Violations

- Epic 6 (Instrumentation for Reliability & Growth) is a technical/business-analytics epic with no direct user outcome. Best practice requires epics to deliver user value; this should be reframed or merged into user-facing epics with explicit user impact.

### 🟠 Major Issues

- Story 1.1 (“Initialize Project from PWA Starter”) is a technical setup story with no user value. It is required by architecture but should be moved to an explicit “Engineering Foundation” track or reframed as a prerequisite task outside user stories.
- Greenfield baseline work is missing explicit stories for dev environment setup and CI/CD pipeline configuration (Architecture specifies GitHub Actions + Cloudflare Pages but no story covers it).
- Unsupported browser handling (NFR19) lacks explicit acceptance criteria in Epic 5 stories; add criteria to ensure friendly warning and degraded experience behavior.

### 🟡 Minor Concerns

- Duplicate “FR Coverage Map” heading in `docs/engineering/epics.md`.
- Story 2.5 combines orientation handling and rotated digits; consider splitting if implementation complexity risks story size.

### Recommendations

- Reframe Epic 6 as user-visible reliability/value (e.g., “Reliable Experience Monitoring”) or fold instrumentation into each epic with explicit user benefit; keep analytics tasks as non-epic work items if needed.
- Add a short “Engineering Foundation” story set (or pre-epic checklist) for project scaffolding and CI/CD setup to keep user stories clean.
- Update Epic 5 acceptance criteria to cover unsupported browsers and “friendly warning + degraded mode” behavior.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

NEEDS WORK

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

- Epic 6 is a technical analytics epic with no direct user value; it must be reframed or absorbed into user-facing epics before implementation planning.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Decide how analytics and reliability instrumentation will be represented (reframe Epic 6 or distribute instrumentation work into user-value epics).
2. Add explicit foundation work for project scaffolding and CI/CD setup, and clarify Story 1.1 as a prerequisite rather than a user story.
3. Update PRD/epics to reflect UX-specific requirements (rotated digits, settings drawer behavior, shadcn/ui/visual direction) and add unsupported-browser acceptance criteria.

### Final Note

This assessment identified 9 issues across 2 categories. Address the critical issues before proceeding to implementation. These findings can be used to improve the artifacts or you may choose to proceed as-is.
